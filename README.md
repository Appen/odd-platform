## Overview

Open Data Platform (ODD Platform) is a reference implementation of [Open Data Discovery Spec](https://github.com/opendatadiscovery/opendatadiscovery-specification).
We’re building a next-generation data discovery and observability tool for enterprises that helps to efficiently democratize data, powers collaboration of data science and data engineering teams, significantly reduces time to data discovery, cuts on data downtime and offers modern, easy-to-use environment with quick time-to-value. ODD makes all your data entities reliable, observable, and easily discoverable.

## Features

### Architecture

* Powered by a universal open standard for metadata collection
* Much faster and of better quality of data discovery  
* Democratizes data across an organization, making it self-service
* Allows building meta catalogs by federating any data catalogs you’re using 
* Composable and pluggable architecture that can fit any data strategy/business 
* Easily integrates with other open standards, data catalogs, tools an ML ecosystem
* Wide variety of data sources (BI, ML, ETL, ELT, data quality tools, warehouses, etc.)
* A multi-cloud solution not tying you to any particular cloud
* Quick and easy deployment without having to provide complex infrastructure
* Fully open-source and community-based - no closed / proprietary agenda  

### Data Discovery 

* Trust your data with truly end-to-end, context-rich data discovery 
* Enrich entities with custom metadata, descriptions, owners and tags  
* Rich context, schemas and lineage for all data entities
* Rich data profiling: overall statistics, labels, descriptions, uniqueness, etc. 
* Discoverable ML entities - ML pipelines, experiments, feature stores are 1st citizens 
* Modern lightweight UI and management of your data sources, owners, tags. 

### Data Observability 

* Truly end-to-end data lineage across all the tools used in the company
* Alerts for changes and issues informing you what/who’s entities were affected
* Empowers collaboration between Data Science and Data Engineering teams  

### Data Quality 

* Lets you enrich any data with data quality tests  
* Easily integrates with any data quality tools

### Data Security & Governance 

* Doesn’t touch actual data for security reasons: operates metadata only  
* Know what data is PII: label PII and other special data at the column level

## Getting Started 

### Building Locally with Docker Compose

Use a docker-compose file to launch ODD Platform on your local machine.

TBD

### Deploying to Kubernetes with Helm Charts
